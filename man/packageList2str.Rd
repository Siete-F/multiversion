\title{Convert package name/version vector to single string.}
\usage{
packageList2str(x, do_return = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named character vector with package names/versions.}

\item{do_return}{If FALSE (the default) the package sting is printed, if TRUE, it is returned as a character string and not printed.}
}
\description{
Used to print a set of package names and their version criteria in a way that \code{parse_dependency_string()} can parse it again to a package list.
This way we can list the dependencies of a function easily and it makes it possible to use it when performing a commandline call.
