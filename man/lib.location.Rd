\usage{
lib.location(set_session_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{set_session_path}{(optional) If no environment variable has been set to indicate the library location,
You can call this function and let it set the environment variable for this session only.}
}
\description{
This function will look for the environment variable \code{R_MV_LIBRARY_LOCATION} indicating the R_MV_library location.
Alternatively you can provide a path for this session only, using \code{\link{lib.location}(yourPath)}.
This will set the environment variable for this session.
(You might want to consider to add this to your \code{.Rprofile} file, see \code{?Startup})
