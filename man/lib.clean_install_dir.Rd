\description{
The temporary installation folder (indicated by \code{lib.location_install_dir()}) is used to install the package before moving ('converting') it to the final location.
This function removes this temporary folder. Make sure that all installed packages that are desired to keep are converted.
You can run the \code{\link{lib.convert}()} once again to make sure this is the case.
