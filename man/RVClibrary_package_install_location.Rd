\title{Return the RVClibrary installation directory.}
\usage{
RVClibrary_package_install_location()
}
\description{
Returns the location of the RVClibrary package. It is a more complicated search than expected since it will find the development folder in a few cases.
The only way to guarantee that the correct folder is found is by checking if the `INDEX` folder is present in the RVClibrary folder.
This folder is only there when it is the installed instance of RVClibrary.
