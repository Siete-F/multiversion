# -------------- do something --------------

#' I met a traveler from an antique land
#' Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
#' Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
#' Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
#' And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
#' Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
#' Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
#' The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
#' And on the pedestal these words appear:
#' ‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
#' Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
#' Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
#' Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
#' The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
