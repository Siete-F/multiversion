# -------------- do something --------------

#' Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
#' Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
#' Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
#' And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:
#' Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
#' And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;
#' And every fair from fair sometime declines,
#' By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d;
#' But thy eternal summer shall not fade
#' Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
#' Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
#' When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st;
#' So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
#' So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
