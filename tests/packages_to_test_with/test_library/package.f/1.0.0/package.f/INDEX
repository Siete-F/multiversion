package_f2              Shall I compare thee to a summer<U+0092>s day?
                        Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough
                        winds do shake the darling buds of May, And
                        summer<U+0092>s lease hath all too short a
                        date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven
                        shines, And often is his gold complexion
                        dimm<U+0092>d; And every fair from fair
                        sometime declines, By chance, or
                        nature<U+0092>s changing course,
                        untrimm<U+0092>d; But thy eternal summer shall
                        not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou
                        ow<U+0092>st; Nor shall Death brag thou
                        wander<U+0092>st in his shade, When in eternal
                        lines to time thou grow<U+0092>st; So long as
                        men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives
                        this, and this gives life to thee.
