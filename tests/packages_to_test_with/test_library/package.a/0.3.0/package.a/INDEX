package_a3              I met a traveler from an antique land Who said:
                        <U+0093>Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
                        Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the
                        sand, Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose
                        frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold
                        command, Tell that its sculptor well those
                        passions read Which yet survive, stamped on
                        these lifeless things, The hand that mocked
                        them, and the heart that fed: And on the
                        pedestal these words appear: <U+0091>My name is
                        Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye
                        Mighty, and despair!<U+0092> Nothing beside
                        remains. Round the decay Of that colossal
                        wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level
                        sands stretch far away.<U+0094>
what_version_are_you    Just some example function. But this function
                        will also be present in another package.
