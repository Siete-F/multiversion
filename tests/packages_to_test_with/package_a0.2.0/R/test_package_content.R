# -------------- do something --------------

#' Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
#' With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
#' Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
#' A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
#' Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
#' Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
#' Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
#' The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
#' “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
#' With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
#' Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
#' The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
#' Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,
#' I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

#' Just some example function.
#' But this function will also be present in another package.
