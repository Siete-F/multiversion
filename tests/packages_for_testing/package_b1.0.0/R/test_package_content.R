# -------------- do something --------------

#' Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness,
#' Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
#' Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
#' A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
#' What leaf-fring’d legend haunts about thy shape
#' Of deities or mortals, or of both,
#' In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
#' What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
#' What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
#' What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
#' 
#' Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
#' Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
#' Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,
#' Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
#' Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
#' Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
#' Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
#' Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
#' She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
#' For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
#' Keats_urn
#' 
#' Keats’s own drawing of the Grecian Urn.
#' 
#' Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
#' Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
#' And, happy melodist, unwearied,
#' For ever piping songs for ever new;
#' More happy love! more happy, happy love!
#' For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,
#' For ever panting, and for ever young;
#' All breathing human passion far above,
#' That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d,
#' A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
