package_e2              Death, be not proud, though some have called
                        thee Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
                        For those whom thou think<U+0092>st thou dost
                        overthrow Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst
                        thou kill me. From rest and sleep, which but
                        thy pictures be, Much pleasure; then from thee
                        much more must flow, And soonest our best men
                        with thee do go, Rest of their bones, and
                        soul<U+0092>s delivery. Thou art slave to fate,
                        chance, kings, and desperate men, And dost with
                        poison, war, and sickness dwell, And poppy or
                        charms can make us sleep as well And better
                        than thy stroke; why swell<U+0092>st thou then?
                        One short sleep past, we wake eternally And
                        death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.
