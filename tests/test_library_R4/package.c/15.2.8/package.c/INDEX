                        green altar, O mysterious priest, Lead’st thou
                        that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her
                        silken flanks with garlands drest? What little
                        town by river or sea shore, Or mountain-built
                        with peaceful citadel, Is emptied of this folk,
                        this pious morn? And, little town, thy streets
                        for evermore Will silent be; and not a soul to
                        tell Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.
