In the forests of the night;

<p>And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? and what dread feet?
</p>
<p>What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp,
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!
</p>
<p>When the stars threw down their spears
And waterâ€™d heaven with their tears:
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
</p>
<p>Tiger Tiger burning bright,
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
