# ============== MAIN FUNCTIONALITY ==============

# -------------- do something --------------

#' Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
#' And sorry I could not travel both
#' And be one traveler, long I stood
#' And looked down one as far as I could
#' To where it bent in the undergrowth;
#'
#' Then took the other, as just as fair,
#' And having perhaps the better claim,
#' Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
#' Though as for that the passing there
#' Had worn them really about the same,
#'
#' And both that morning equally lay
#' In leaves no step had trodden black.
#' Oh, I kept the first for another day!
#' Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
#' I doubted if I should ever come back.
#'
#' I shall be telling this with a sigh
#' Somewhere ages and ages hence:
#' Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
#' I took the one less traveled by,
#' And that has made all the difference.
